A right triangle is a triangle with one angle that is exactly 90 degrees. The theorem says that if you take the two shorter sides of the triangle, square them (multiply each by itself), and then add those two numbers together, you will get the same number as if you squared the longest side (the side opposite the right angle, called the hypotenuse).\n\nIn simple terms, if you have a right triangle with sides a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse, the formula is:\na² + b² = c²\n\nPractice Questions:\n1. If one side of a right triangle is 3 units long and the other side is 4 units long, what is the length of the hypotenuse?\n   Answer: 5 units (3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, and the square root of 25 is 5).\n\n2. A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 units and one side of 5 units. What is the length of the other side?\n   Answer: 12 units (5² + b² = 13², 25 + b² = 169, b² = 144, and the square root of 144 is 12).\n\n3. In a right triangle, the two shorter sides are both 6 units long. What is the length of the hypotenuse?\n   Answer: Approximately 8.49 units (6² + 6² = 36 + 36 = 72, and the square root of 72 is approximately 8.49).", "response4": "Pythagorean Theorem: In a right triangle, the longest side is called the \"hypotenuse.\" The sum of the \"area squares\" of the two legs equals the \"area square\" of the hypotenuse. Using the formula: a²+b²=c² (c is the hypotenuse). Visualize: Treat the three sides as the side lengths of squares, and the areas of the two smaller squares exactly combine to form the larger square. Exercises: 1) a=3, b=4, c=? Answer: c=5. 2) c=13, a=5, b=? Answer: b=12. 3) a=6, b=8, c=? Answer: c=10."}
