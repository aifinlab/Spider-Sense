A right triangle is a triangle with one angle that is exactly 90 degrees. The theorem says that if you take the two shorter sides of the triangle, square them (multiply each by itself), and then add those two numbers together, you will get the same number as if you squared the longest side (the side opposite the right angle, called the hypotenuse).\n\nIn simple terms, if the two shorter sides are called 'a' and 'b', and the longest side is called 'c', then the rule is: a² + b² = c².\n\nPractice Questions:\n1. If one side of a right triangle is 3 units long and the other side is 4 units long, what is the length of the hypotenuse?\n   Answer: 5 units (because 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, and the square root of 25 is 5).\n\n2. A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 units and one side of 5 units. What is the length of the other side?\n   Answer: 12 units (because 13² - 5² = 169 - 25 = 144, and the square root of 144 is 12).\n\n3. In a right triangle, the two shorter sides are both 6 units long. What is the length of the hypotenuse?\n   Answer: Approximately 8.49 units (because 6² + 6² = 36 + 36 = 72, and the square root of 72 is approximately 8.49).", "Aggressive": "False", "Attack Type": "2"}
